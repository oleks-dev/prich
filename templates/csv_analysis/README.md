# CSV Analysis Template

  * Takes a CSV file as input (e.g., sales data).

  * Uses a Python script to parse the CSV and compute summary statistics (e.g., total sales, average price).

  * Renders a Jinja2 template to prompt the LLM for business insights based on the summary.

  * Uses the default shared venv with pandas for CSV processing.
